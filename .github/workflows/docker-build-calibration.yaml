# Build calibration when "base" changes, or when any files in the calibration
# folder are modified
# As it is highly improvable that we change code inside the calibration folder,
# it is good to trigger a build once a week to take into account changes in the
# third party repos.
# Additionally, it is good to have a manual trigger button for the build
